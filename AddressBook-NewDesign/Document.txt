Address Book
The Address Book project is a simple command-line application written in C that allows a user to
create, search, edit, delete, and list contact details. Each contact holds a name, phone number,
and email address. The project is a demonstration of file handling, structure usage, validation,
and menu-driven interfaces in C.
Contacts are stored in separate files:
- family.txt — Family group contacts
- friend.txt — Friends group contacts
- office.txt — Office group contacts
Software requirement is GCC C compiler.
Dependencies are Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, ctype.h, string.h)

Code Organization

main.c --> Handles the menu and program flow
contact.c --> Implements core contact management features
file.c --> Implements data validation and display functions
